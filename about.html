              <b>Save.ca</b> is a mobile app project that I developed and maintained while working at Metroland Media Group Ltd, from September 2014 - December 2014.
              While working there, a fellow co-op and I single-handedly increased the iOS app's rating from 1 star to 4 stars, and the Android app's rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time of my co-op placement, the logic code for these two apps was written in Javascript and executed through the Javascript engine on Android and iOS.
              This helped the project to have plenty of code reuse, but as a downside, the apps were single-threaded.

              <b>TicTacToe</b> is a Native Android app that I developed for a coding challenge. This app has two modes: PVP and PVE. PVP allows two players to face against each other, while PVE is playing against the AI. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to determine its next moves. I did not write the Minimax code myself but used a modified version of the code found
              <a href="https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/JavaGame_TicTacToe_AI.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The project was completed within two days.

              If you would like to see the source code for this app, please contact me.

              The <b>Game of Game of Life</b>, based on Conway's Game of life, is a Native Android app written in collaboration with my roommates during university.
              Each of us worked on a different game mode of the app. I wrote the multiplayer mode, where two players compete against each other by trying to get as many cells as they can inside their territory on the grid.
              This part of the game uses the canvas from default graphics library of Android to draw the grid.
            </p>
            <p>
              This app was and still is incomplete, so it is likely that it will never be published to the Google Play Store at this point.
